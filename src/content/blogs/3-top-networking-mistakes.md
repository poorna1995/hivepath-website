Professional Networking is not a one-time activity. It isn't just talking for ten minutes or so, asking for credentials, and not looking back again. It is not just building your connection, but keeping up with your connection.
You have to strive for it and keep your connection healthy with your network. You have to make sure you check on your network. Although there are many tips to expand your network, there are few mistakes you might need to avoid to not fail your networking grind.

### Top six mistakes to be avoided while Networking:

To make your Networking strong, you need to do your homework, be very vigilant not to commit any mistakes, and multiply all your goals and efforts with zero. Let's talk about some common mistakes and how you can avoid them.

#### 1. Not dressing up properly.

The type of clothes you wear has a huge impact on your personality. People judge you for the type of clothes you are wearing. One must wear according to the event they are attending. If you have a dressing sense, they focus on the quality of the cloth you have donned. The color combination of your attire also matters.

#### How to avoid?

Formal dress-up is suitable for any event you are attending. Moreover, one can learn what kind of audience is attending the event. You will have an idea to stand out in your event and be the center of attention. That's how you will welcome more and more networks to yourself.

#### 2. Misbehavior damages your image.

Good behavior can impart a positive influence on your networks and connections. One can misbehave through his actions, words, dealings, and body language. Using offensive humor can also play a major role in adding you to the category of waywardness. Along with professional misconduct, you must not personally attack because it is also regarded as misbehavior and fail your networking efforts.

#### How to avoid:

Mannerism should be your best trait. The words you speak, the way you speak them, the tone of your voice; everything should depict how well-mannered of a person you are. Personal attacks are an extreme form of misconduct.

- Avoid commenting and judging one's personal life in a room full of professionals.
- In a networking environment, you should always radiate positive vibes to a positive aura in the surroundings to create healthy and respectful relationships within your network.

#### 3. Staying Silent and reactionless

Networking is always based on response. Not reacting and giving zero feedback while the other person is expecting might wear off them, and they will lose interest in the conversation.

- They will not want to build a conversation with you if they do not receive an answer because they will think you are either not interested or your mind is diverted.
- Tedious behavior is never appreciated. If your company is boring out your network, they will break the connection with you.

#### How to avoid?

Always try to maintain good communication while you are building a network. Good eye contact, a smiling face, and an appreciative gesture if they tell you about their credentials can make you go places and expand your network. Being a good listener and providing your feedback to your networks will form a good impression.

#### 4. Major turnoff

One thing that could add up to the major turnoff in Networking is the factor of asking for favors, help, and referrals without building your network strong. Suppose you start asking and demanding a favor at the very start without building a successful and productive network and connection. In that case, this might lead to dissatisfaction and annoy your connection out.

#### How to avoid?

Start by making your position in your network strong. Build your authenticity. Develop the psyche of giving favors first. It is how they will reciprocate back the favors. For referrals, form a good impression on everyone. Let them acknowledge your work only by your hard work.

#### 5. Not following up with your connection.

If you meet someone up for once, that doesn't mean you have built a network. You have to build your contact and make it valuable. Networking is a relationship you have to form over time. Not interacting from time to time will weaken the network. This will lack the factor of know-how, trust, and confidence. Your network will not be able to trust you.

#### How to avoid?

Keep communicating and interacting with your network. Do a quick check on them and ask them how they are keeping up with their work. If your network has suggested something to you, let them know how their advice or suggestion has helped you excel in your career. Show gratitude. Plan a coffee meetup or a get-together.

#### 6. Not getting out of your bubble.

You have to leave your comfort zone and come out of your social bubble. A lot of people find it difficult to leave their circle and interact with others to build their network. Their social anxiety becomes a grudge in expanding their network, but they do not know they are committing a big mistake. You will never be able to expand your network if your fears stop you.

#### How to avoid?

Humans are social animals, but at times dreaded by the anxiety of socializing with others. It is okay to have social anxiety. Hey, come on, it is completely normal and natural. But that is how you test yourself by how naturally you pull up your anxiety and drink your fears.
Embrace your fears! Go around, start being social, initiate conversations, ask about people and tell them about yourself. Try to mingle with human beings. The more you start socializing, the more you will start to build your confidence and lessen your social anxiety. A moment will come; you will not have to face any problem in building your network for the future because practice makes a man perfect.

#### Final Thoughts:

These are some of the mistakes we all should avoid if we want to develop professional networking with others. You need to give value to others to stay happy and that can only be done with good networking.
